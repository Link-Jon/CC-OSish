function enigma(str,wheels,strtcode)
    --[[
        Arg[1], String to decode/encode.
        Arg[2], If defined, how many wheels it will use.
        Arg[3], If defined, uses str as the startcode.

        While the enigma machine has been cracked,
        AND i only plan to use 1 wheel and no board...
        I think this will work fine for encrypting
        ..
        actually no, i need ATLEAST two wheels, 
        otherwise recreating this is pointless.
        How about a way to add more wheels whenever?
        The wheels can just be tables. 
        (maybe tables inside a table, but i dont want to do that.)
        Along with this, i need to decide how i want to randomize.
        os.time(), the weather...
